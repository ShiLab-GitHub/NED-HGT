## Introduction
* Source code for the paper "Predicting molecular solubility with heterogeneous graph transformer network".

* we propose a message-passing-based heterogeneous graph neural network to predict the solubility properties of drug molecules. With a carefully designed multi-view heterogeneous graph, this model can learn more chemical information and structural information from molecules.
